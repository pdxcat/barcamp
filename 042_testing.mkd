# Testing

* How to test your code? Spec tests -> Good.
* Eventually however, you must test on a box.

* Lets revisit the MODULEPATH and MANIFESTPATH variables:

  ENVIRONMENT=production
  MODULEPATH=/etc/puppet/environments/$ENVIRONMENT/modules
  MANIFESTS=/etc/puppet/environments/$ENVIRONMENT/manifests

* Now every folder under /etc/puppet/environment/ is a perfectly vaild puppet environment
  with its own modulepath and manifests.

* Puppet environments can be accessed on a client by execing

    puppet agent --test --environment=test_nibz_fix_something
