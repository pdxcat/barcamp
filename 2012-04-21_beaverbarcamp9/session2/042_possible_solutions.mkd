# Possible Solutions

## Set up a shared test puppetmaster

Why don't we just set up a second puppetmaster server, call it
the test server, and be done with it?

* Doesn't actually address fully the testing workflow problem
* Does mean our developers could (if we fleshed this idea out
  more) push their code to the test server to test their
  code
* One test server, n developers working on m projects... Hmm.
* This is not a bad idea, but it's not yet complete.
