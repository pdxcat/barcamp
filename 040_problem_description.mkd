# What is our Problem?

## Our Environment

* We use Puppet
* We use Git

## Problem

* After developing new puppet code, we need to test it
* Testing production puppet involves both a client and
  a server
* We do not issue our volunteer developers their own
  personal puppetmasters and we can't realistically
  expect them to build their own
* We want our developers to have the same (or similar)
  flexibility with testing that they have with git
  branching
